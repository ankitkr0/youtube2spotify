# YouTube to Spotify Converter

Welcome to the YouTube to Spotify Converter! This handy tool watches for any YouTube Music links you copy to your clipboard and instantly transforms them into Spotify links for your convenience.

## Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

We've made setting up this tool as straightforward as possible, so you don't need to be a developer to get it up and running! Just follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Check Your Python Version

This project runs on Python, so you'll need to have it installed on your computer. Specifically, you need Python version 3.6 or newer. If you're not sure what version of Python you have, or if you need to install it, here's how you can check:

- Open your command line or terminal.
- Type `python --version` and press Enter.
- If you see a version number starting with 3.6 or higher, you're all set! If not, or if you see an error message, you'll need to install Python. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download instructions and select the version that's right for your operating system.

### Step 2: Download the Project

Next, you'll need to get a copy of this project onto your computer. This process is called "cloning" in Git terminology. Don't worry; it's quite simple:

- If you don't already have Git installed, you'll need to install it. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Once Git is installed, open your command line or terminal.
- Navigate to the folder where you want to download the project. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, if you want to download it to your Desktop, you might type `cd Desktop`.
- Now, type the following command and press Enter: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/YouTube-to-Spotify-Converter.git` (Note: replace "your-username" with the actual username where the project is hosted).
- The project will be downloaded to your chosen directory.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the YouTube to Spotify Converter on your computer. Follow any additional instructions provided in the project to start converting links!
